        This project is a decentralized exchange (DEX) platform that enables
        users to swap tokens directly from a predefined token list
        (tokenList.json). Built with Web3 technology, it provides a secure and
        user-friendly interface for token swapping, leveraging blockchain's
        transparency and immutability. Credit to Moralis Team. Developed by{" "}
